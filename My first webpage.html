  <!--This is the solution to question two-->
  <p> I have a burning desire for research essentially in the field of Geophysics.
       Having had a background during my first degree and conducted research in my masters degree; 
       I grew more curious and this has fueled my interest to further to dive deep into conducting 
       more researches, this is why I would speedily grab the opportunity to do a PhD. I carried out
        my masters research in applied geophysics; the research topic is” Integration of Borehole Geophysical
         data and 3D seismic data in Reservoir characterization”. Geomechanics in oil production optimization 
         incorporates Rock physics which is a key component in oil and gas exploitation for better petroleum
          exploration, development and production. This research is targeted at determining the in-situ stress
           field orientation of the targeted formation for better design of wells, horizontal wells and hydraulic 
           fracturing; measurement of the geomechanical properties, such as rock tensile strength, formation compressive
            strength, Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio, Bulk modulus and rock compressibility  to improve well stability
             during both drilling and production stages; Measuring the petrophysical parameters such as Porosity, Permeability,
             ater saturation, Formation factor, Resistivity, Sonic log… etc of the reservoir; Generating a simulated model of the
              reservoir at different phases such as Early Exploration, Early Production, mid Production etc. To Develop laboratory
              tware) capacity and skills in geomechanics among prospective students within the Niger-Delta region and environment ;
               understanding these(geomechanical) properties of the Niger-Delta regions in Nigeria will improve the success rate of 
               illing production wells and reduce the overall cost of production due to the proper location of these wells, the 
               better yield of oil from these wells and ensuring an effective crude oil optimization through the life span of the 
               well without experiencing a sudden drop in oil production.

<p><ins>Eventhough</ins>During <strong> production, </strong>there are some cases where some 
    wells and reservoirs yield a large amount of crude at the beginning of the production
     phases, but as time passes a <i> production decrease </i> is experienced; this is due to some 
     geomechanical phenomena such as <b> subsurface stress </b> distribution, wellbore instability,
      rock deformations or pipeline failure. Such problems could be avoided, if identified
       at the early stages of the <mark> exploration, </mark> and if the Geoscientists and engineers are 
       able to take optimal <em> decisions at the early stage </em> of the exploration. The aim of this 
       research <del> research </del> is to establish an understanding of the geomechanical parameters of a field in the Niger-Delta
        before <sub> exploration, </sub> during exploration and over a period of production. Subsequently to establish a 
       <small> geomechanical model </small> of a reservoir that may be applied in a typical Niger-Delta environment. </p>
